Courses on dating and sexual performance, as well as courses promoting unproven fringe theories, are among them. Udemy has also clarified several of its previous content policies like their course policy for younger students. Since Udemy is designed for mature learners and their Terms of Service require instructors as well as learners to be at least 18 years old to join up, they will not allow content that is overtly aimed at young students. Courses that assist parents in teaching or learning alongside younger students, on the other hand, are still permissible.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;strong&gt;Updates On Privacy Policy&lt;\/strong&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Udemy may adjust their Privacy Policy from time to time, and if they make some major changes, they will inform users by an email or a notification published on their website. &amp;nbsp;Udemy will also provide a synopsis of the major updates, and unless otherwise specified, updates will take effect on the same day that they are published.&lt;\/p&gt;"},"cashBackCurrency":null,"cashBackConfig":null,"go":"w8B9Z2","rated_user_count":"1883","parentStore":null,"socials":[{"name":"official facebook page","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/udemy\/"},{"name":"official twitter","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/udemy"},{"name":"official instagram","url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/udemy\/"},{"name":"official linkedin","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/udemy\/"},{"name":"official pinterest","url":"https:\/\/www.pinterest.com\/udemy"},{"name":"official youtube channel","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/udemy"},{"name":"wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Udemy"}],"keywordStore":[{"name":"Udemy Discount 50% OFF","alias":"udemy-discount-50-off","logo":"https:\/\/tenereteam.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\/udemy.webp?v=1709865231","coupon_count":29}],"similar_store":{"princeton-review":"Princeton Review","aromahead":"Aromahead","acumobility":"Acumobility","expertrating":"ExpertRating","theotrade":"TheoTrade"},"short_store_url":"Udemy.com","rated_star":"3.8","h1_title":"Udemy Coupons &amp; Promo Codes with 100% off (303 Working Codes) March 2024","cash_back_term":"","parent_store_id":null,"store_url":"https:\/\/www.udemy.com","affiliate_url":"https:\/\/go.skimresources.com?id=141977X1670779&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2F","total_donated":null,"meta_title":"","meta_desc":"","about_coupon_cta":"Are you looking for ways to save money when shopping at &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Udemy&lt;\/b&gt;&lt;\/b&gt;.
